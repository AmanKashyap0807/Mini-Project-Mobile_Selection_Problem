# Mobile Selection Problem: A TOPSIS-Based Solution

**The Challenge:** Mobile selecting is a complex problem in today's vast marketplace. With countless models, features, and price points, finding the perfect phone can be overwhelming.

**The Solution:** This project aims to simplify the mobile selection process using the TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) algorithm. TOPSIS is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method that helps evaluate and rank alternatives based on multiple, often conflicting criteria.

## How It Works

1. **Identify Criteria:** Define the factors that matter most to you when choosing a phone (e.g., price, camera quality, battery life, processor speed, display size).
2. **Gather Data:** Collect relevant information on available mobile phones, including their specifications and ratings for each criterion.
3. **Apply TOPSIS:** Use the TOPSIS algorithm to calculate a weighted score for each phone, considering the relative importance of each criterion.
4. **Rank Alternatives:** The phones with the highest TOPSIS scores are the most suitable options based on your preferences.

## Why TOPSIS?

* **Handles Multiple Criteria:** TOPSIS accounts for a wide range of factors, making it ideal for complex decisions like mobile selection.
* **Considers Trade-offs:** It helps you understand the compromises involved in choosing one phone over another.
* **Objective and Systematic:** The algorithm provides a structured and unbiased way to evaluate options.
